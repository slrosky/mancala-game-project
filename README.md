# Mancala
### Mancala is considered to be one of the (historically) oldest games still played in modern times. Variations of the game are played all over the world, from India, to Ethiopia, to Egypt, to the Caribbean, and the Americas. Similarities among the many variations used today include the folowing elements: (1) a board or solid substrate that includes hollowed out pods to house playing pieces, and (2) 48 playing pieces traditionally made of stone or glass (most commonly marbles). It is a simple, but important game of strategy that has stood the test of time.

## Views During Play
Upon initializing the game, user will see a rendered game board including all starting pieces in their rightful locations. Additionally, Player One and Player Two are both indicated on which side of the board their turns will need to originate from.
